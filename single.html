                <h3>Summary</h3>
                  <p>This study aimed to enhance Capital Bikeshare’s operations and support urban transportation reinvention through exploratory data analysis. By analyzing public data from 2011–2012, we examined ridership growth, seasonal and weather impacts, and station locality characteristics.  

                    Key recommendations include adding stations near workshops and colleges, optimizing bike availability during peak hours (7–9 AM, 5–6 PM), introducing seasonal pricing to boost fall and winter usage, utilizing route data for dedicated bike lanes, conducting maintenance at night to minimize disruption, and offering weekend discounts to convert registered users into casual riders.</p>

                  <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is a critical step in assessing the performance of a bike-sharing demand forecasting model. Use various metrics to evaluate the performance of a model, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared).</p>
                    <p>
                      <img src="images/predict.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                    </p>
                  <p>You should evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared. MAE and RMSE measure the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values. R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable, explained by the input variables.</p>
